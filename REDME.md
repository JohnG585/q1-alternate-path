#Q1 Project

For my Q1 project, I decided to make a video game which utilized HTML, CSS, Materialize, JSON, JavaScript, 
Audacity and Phaser. Since I didn’t reference a preexisting API, I created my own JSON file to pull additional info, 
such as the position of platforms, items, and speeds/replacement rates of individual sprites.   The object of the web-based 
game is to find the missing g44 instructor Pete, by controlling instructors Craig, Lisa, and Teddi through three 
increasingly challenging levels. It’s an homage to the classic, retro video games from the days of NES and SNES, 
complete with classic video game music and sound effects. Video games were a large part of my life growing up, so much 
so that I have several tattoos of classic video game characters. 

##The most challenging parts of the game include:

 ###- Making the “sprites” 	
 
    - Sprites are the movable and immovable objects in the game itself, such as the characters, 
    the platforms, and villains. I created every element you see in the game, outside of the background images (found 
    on Google Images), stationary fires and platforms (taken from Phaser’s demo page). Using Preview, GIMP, and Sketch, 
    I crafted each character, boss, and obstacle, as well as positioning each sprite throughout each individual level. 

 ###- Learning Phaser 	
    - Phaser utilizes JS, however it also has it’s own programming language. When I started the 
    program it seemed rather daunting, however after a while it became pretty simple. Once I got over the original hurdle of 
    learning what certain commands do, the rest of the project fell in line. 

### - Volume/Music
 
	  - Surprisingly, I am having a difficult time controlling the volume of both the music and sound effects. 
    I attempted to remedy this issue through Audacity, however it can distort the sound of the file, or it makes it too 
    loud/too low. Phaser’s recommended solutions proved to be ineffectual. Therefore one level has blaring music, while other 
    states have music which is barely above a whisper. In the future I plan to fix this once I find a solution. Also: the 
    music for the main menu would replay when you moved from screen to screen within the main menu, but it wouldn’t stop once 
    you left a page. I had to alter my code to start at the beginning of each menu page instead of playing throughout the 
    menu states. 

Most feedback I’ve received has been positive, and some of it has led to new features. 
Lisa’s joke that “no one cares about Pete” led to me creating a separate screen off the menu, which can be 
reached by clicking on the “I Don’t Care About Pete!” button.
